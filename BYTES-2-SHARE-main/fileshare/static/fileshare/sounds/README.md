# Sound Effects for BYTES-2-SHARE

## Adding the Minecraft Explosion Sound

For copyright reasons, we cannot include the actual Minecraft explosion sound file in this repository. To complete the implementation:

1. Download a Minecraft explosion sound effect from a legal source
2. Rename the file to `explosion.mp3`
3. Place it in this directory (`/fileshare/static/fileshare/sounds/`)

## Alternative Options

If you cannot obtain the Minecraft explosion sound, you can use any other explosion or celebration sound effect. Just make sure to:

1. Name it `explosion.mp3`
2. Place it in this directory
3. Ensure it's in MP3 format
